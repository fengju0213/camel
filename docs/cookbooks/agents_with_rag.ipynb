Our approach enables communicative agents to collaborate autonomously toward completing tasks while requiring minimal human intervention, leading to better solutions are per our thorough evaluations. Through our analysis, we show that achieving autonomous cooperation is challenging due to issues like conversation deviation,'}]\n"

      "\n",
      "4. **Fork the Repository**: If you plan to make changes, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to work on your changes without affecting the main project.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. **Documentation Gaps**: Occasionally, the documentation may not cover all aspects of the setup process, leading to confusion. In such cases, reaching out to the community for clarification can be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
